MyToken
MyToken is a Solidity smart contract that represents a basic ERC20 token with the ability to mint and burn tokens.

Description
The MyToken contract is a simple implementation of an ERC20 token that allows for the creation and destruction of tokens. The token has a name, symbol, and total supply, and balances are stored in a mapping variable. The mint function allows a designated address to create new tokens, while the burn function allows the same address to destroy tokens.

Getting Started
To get started with the MyToken contract, follow these instructions:

Installing
You can download the MyToken contract by copying the code from the project repository or by creating a new contract in your preferred Solidity development environment and pasting the code.

Modifying
If you want to modify the MyToken contract, you can change the values for the token name and symbol, as well as update the mint and burn functions to add additional functionality.

Executing program
To execute the MyToken contract, follow these steps:

Compile the contract using a Solidity compiler such as Remix.
Deploy the contract to your desired blockchain network.
Use the mint function to create new tokens.
Use the burn function to destroy tokens.
Help
If you encounter any issues while using the MyToken contract, please refer to the Solidity documentation or seek assistance from the project contributors.
